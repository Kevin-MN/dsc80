    "- For data to be MCAR, the chance that values are missing should not depend on any other column or the values themselves.\n",

    "| Galaxy Z Fold 3 | 7.6 | NaN |\n",
    "| OnePlus 9 Pro | 6.7 | 799 |\n",
    "| iPhone 12 Pro Max | 6.68 | NaN |\n",
    "\n",
    "- If prices are MCAR, then **the distribution of screen size should be the same** for:\n",
    "    - phones whose prices are missing, and \n",
    "    - phones whose prices aren't missing.\n",
    "- **We can use a permutation test to decide between MAR and MCAR!** We are asking the question, did these two samples come from the same underlying distribution?"
